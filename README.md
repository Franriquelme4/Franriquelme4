### Hello World! 👋
I’m a software engineer with 5 years of experience, currently working remotely from Paraguay for a Chile-based healthcare tech company. My main focus is on building scalable web applications using Laravel, Vue 3, and modern API-driven architectures. I care deeply about writing clean, maintainable code and collaborating with international teams to deliver high-quality products, including the integration of generative AI to automate medical appointment scheduling through WhatsApp.
Beyond work, I’m passionate about continuous learning and exploring emerging technologies. I’m currently researching zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain-based solutions as part of my thesis, and I enjoy contributing to projects that push my technical depth and problem-solving skills.
